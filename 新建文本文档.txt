white bunny and gray bunny

An old goat is harvesting cabbage in his field. white & gray come to help.
After harvest, the old gave a cart of cabbage to gray. gray received, said: thank you!
Then the old gave another cart of cabbage to white. white says, "I don't need cabbage, please give me some seed of them.". in that case the old gave white some seeds.
white back to home and prepared the land untight and planted those seeds of cabbage.
Some days after, the cabbage grows up. Little white bunny keeps irrigating the growing cabbages, fertillizating, removing random grasses, catching pests. soon these cabbages grown.
But little gray bunny, after he takes those cabbage home, he stops working. when he hungries, just eat those old goat's gift.
sooner, he finishes all cabbages he has, and he goes to old goat to ask for more.
Then he saw the white bunny hanging(carrying) some cabbages and giving them to old goat. gray is curious, he asks: white bunny, where you got your cabbages?
white says: I planted them myself. Only planting oneself, will have endless cabbage to eat.
